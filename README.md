## 1. About the project

The Tourbilon was mainly inspired by kinetic art sculpture _Infinity - David C. Roy_. If you are intrested 
in kinetic art definitley look him up! Unlike the original, Tourbilon is powered by 2 motors so it can run infinitley!

In design I've tried to use standardized and widely used parts, so it would be easy to replicate by anyone! This creates
funny over-kills such as driving shafts through NEMA 17 motors
